 
\section*{Deliverables and Evaluation}

There are four anticipated deliverables. The first is a software for generating drawings of plane graphs. The second is an animation of the proof that every forest is unavoidable for Online Ramsey Games played on forests. The third and fourth are the report on status of Online Ramsey Games played on planar graphs and the final report. Their due dates follow the schedule presented in the previous section. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 10/01/2021 Software to draw plane graphs and simulate Builder and Painter actions
	\item 10/15/2021 Animation showing every forest is unavoidable
	\item 11/15/2021 Report on the status of Online Ramsey Games played on Planar Graphs
	\item 12/01/2021 Final Report
\end{enumerate}


The full evaluation also takes into account the expected weekly meetings and full log of activities. Although this is not the result of the work, it may reflect the time and effort put into the project better than the set of deliverables. In this sense, note that the schedule presented in the previous section might go through some adjustments if needed. These changes will be approved by the sponsoring faculty.
