This section collects results of the Online Ramsey Game where both $G$ and $H$ are restricted to planar graphs. The first part of the section brings results from \textit{On-line Ramsey Theory}\todo{cite}, the paper that originated this study. The second part brings advancements made on \textit{Online Ramsey Theory for Planar Graphs}\todo{cite}. The section ends with extracts from \textit{Online Ramsey theory for a triangle on $F$‚Äêfree graphs}\todo{cite} that raises some questions on key subgraphs used by the Left in its strategy.

1st part:

The class of forests is self-unavoidable.

C3 is avoidable on the class of outerplanar graphs.

C3 in unavoidable on the class of planar 2-degenerate graphs.

Every cycle is unavoidable on planar graphs.

$K4\setminus \{e\}$ is unavoidable on planar graphs.

Conjecture 

2nd part:

Conjecture is wrong. $\Rightarrow$, but no $\Leftarrow$. Long proof and too many details to cover shortly. Find a way to simplify or only show key points and refer text...

Conjecture

3rd:

Say what F-Free is

Show result (when it is unavoidable and when it is not)

Raise question "For a given target $H$ and colorset $\mathcal{C}$, is there a finite collection of sets of graphs $\mathcal{F} = \{\mathcal{S}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{S}_n\}$ such that the builder needs all of $\mathcal{S}_i$ and no other graphs, other then their subdivisions, to make $H$ unavoidable"? 

If there is, what is the minimum number of forbidden subgraphs to make $H$ avoidable?
