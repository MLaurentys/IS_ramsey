On master thesis:
 Theorem 1.2 page 9:
 The relation between the offline
and the online theory is that if G is Ramsey big for H then Builder can force a
monochromatic copy of H on G. However, the opposite implication does not hold
as we see from the result of Grytczuk et al. [8]. They studied Builderâ€™s strategies
when Builder has to draw a graph only from fixed classes

ramsey arrowing vs big graph

Did not find anywhere saying online algorithm is not competitive with normal one,
although I know they are not competitive
