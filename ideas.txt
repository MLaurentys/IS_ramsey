The relation between the offline
and the online theory is that if G is Ramsey big for H then Builder can force a
monochromatic copy of H on G. However, the opposite implication does not hold
as we see from the result of Grytczuk et al. [8].

his is an interesting result because if we have a forest T we can color it such
that it contains only monochromatic copies of stars. We can root every compo-
nent C of T in some vertex v ∈ V (C) and color C alternatively by layers. The
edges incident with v are blue, edges in the distance 1 from v are red and so on.
Hence, any monochromatic subgraph of T is a star. Therefore, any forest T is
not Ramsey big for any forest T′ such that T′ contains a path P3 as a subgraph. [masters]
