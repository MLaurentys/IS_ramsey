- **WEEK 5:**
  - Fixed Cyto to Graph6 representation, but there might be a problem with recalculating it repeatedely
  - Started Graph6 to Cyto
  - Started the simulation tool
- **08/09/2021:**
  - Started Cytoscape to graph6 conversion
  - Looked for but could not find Bit Array for JS, probably implementing that using Number in the future
- **07/09/2021:**
  - Draft of graph6 implementation
  - Looked for but could not find graph6 <-> cytoscape converter
  - Experimented with bootstrap css
- **03/09/2021:**
  - Studied and understood graph6 format
- **01/09/2021:**
  - Finished port to redux and achieved a state that I believe the quality of
    the code is good and able to extend without requiring modification
  - Added some file handle comments
- **31/08/2021:**
  - Added redux to react application to improve code quality
- **30/08/2021:**
  - Created react app and moved previos code to typescript
  - Experimented react version of cytoscape but did not like that
  - Decided to move forwards with cytoscape because it seems to have a better
    API for creating simulations

  - Created a base app and tested graph libraries
- **27/08/2021:**
